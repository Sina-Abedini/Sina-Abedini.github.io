          <h2>About</h2>
          <p>
           <p style="text-align: justify;">
    My name is Sina Abedini. I was born and raised in Tehran, Iran. After being accepted into Mofid 2 high school, one of the top high schools in Tehran, I chose the Natural Sciences program due to my fascination with biology. It was in my final year of study that I realized my obsession with the unknown and my curiosity to find answers to fundamental questions about nature, life, and disease could only be addressed through a career in science and research. Despite the many hardships, my passion carried me through, and I saw every failure as a chance to become better, learn from my mistakes, and improve upon them. Finally, I achieved my goal of enrolling in the Biotechnology undergraduate program at the oldest and most prominent university in Iran, the University of Tehran, to which admission is limited to the top one percent of students who pass the highly competitive national entrance examination.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
    Though excited and ready for a new chapter in my life, the Covid-19 pandemic struck, and I was deprived of attending classes until online courses were introduced. By observing the events that were unfolding and seeing scientists and healthcare workers all around the world hard at work to solve this biological problem and save lives, I became more certain than ever that I was on the right path and decided that I will spend all my focus and energy on learning the necessary concepts and devote myself to a life of education and research that will improve the lives of others while simultaneously quenching my thirst for knowledge.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
    My first year of studies laid a solid foundation in calculus and statistics, which provided me with a quantitative insight and elucidated the importance of modeling and data analysis in order to have a rational and efficient approach to understanding biological phenomena. In addition, the heavy coursework in general, physical, and organic chemistry sparked a newfound interest in chemical biology in me and made me realize that the key to truly understanding the intricacies of the cell and being able to develop the right drugs to address disease on a molecular level lies within an in-depth knowledge of the chemistry of life and molecular structures.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
    This knowledge was honed during my second year through the biochemistry and cellular biology courses, which made me certain that a career path in drug design and development best suits my interests. In addition, heavy coursework in molecular genetics, genetic engineering, and immunology coupled with an elective course in virology in my third year of studies introduced me to the world of gene therapy and personalized medicine, which utilize viral vectors carrying genes edited with the aid of CRISPR technology designed to replace faulty genes in patients. Also, courses in large-scale production processes and chemical engineering familiarized me with the technical challenges faced during the scale-up process and provided me with a holistic view of a pharmaceutical compound's journey from bench to bedside.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
    Armed with this vast array of knowledge in different areas of biotechnology, I was ready to take on teaching assistantships for the biochemistry and general biology courses and be able to simultaneously strengthen my knowledge, help my younger peers, and embrace my passion for teaching. Also, I was able to acquire an internship position at Zist Darman Mahan biopharmaceutical company where I got familiarized with lab procedures and the overall production process of probiotic pharmaceutics for humans and livestock. My experience showed me that precision, communication, teamwork, and hands-on critical thinking are integral to functioning properly in the lab and producing error-free results.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
    Parallel to these experiences, I managed several team presentations on topics such as SMA Gene therapy drugs, CRISPR tec
